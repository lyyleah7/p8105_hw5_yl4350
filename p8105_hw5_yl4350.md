# Problem 2

  - Start with a dataframe containing all file names

<!-- end list -->

``` r
filename = tibble(file_name = list.files("./data"))
```

  - Iterate over file names and read in data for each subject using
    `purrr::map` and saving the result as a new variable in the
    dataframe

<!-- end list -->

``` r
path = vector("list", length = 20)

for (i in 1:20) {
  path[i] = str_c("./data/", filename[i,1])
}

data = map(path, read_csv)
```

``` r
df = 
  filename %>% 
  mutate(data = data)%>% 
  unnest()
```

  - Tidy the result; manipulate file names to include control arm and
    subject ID, make sure weekly observations are “tidy”, and do any
    other tidying that’s necessary

<!-- end list -->

``` r
df_clean =
  df %>%
  separate(file_name, into = c("arm", "subject_id"), sep = "_") %>% 
  mutate(
    subject_id = str_remove(subject_id, pattern = ".csv"),
    arm = str_replace(arm, "con", "control"),
    arm = str_replace(arm, "exp", "experimental")
  ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    3:10,
    names_to = "week",
    names_prefix = "week_"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    arm = as.factor(arm),
    subject_id = as.factor(subject_id),
    week = as.factor(week)
  )
```

  - Make a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over
    time, and comment on differences between groups

<!-- end list -->

``` r
plot =
  df_clean %>% 
  group_by(week, arm, subject_id) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = value, color = subject_id))+
  geom_line(aes(group = subject_id))+
  facet_grid(.~arm)+
  labs(title = "Observations on each subject over time")

plot
```

The values in control group is almost consistant over time but the
values in experimental group have an overall increasing trend within 8
weeks.

# Problem 3

Effect size is the difference between true beta\_1 value and beta\_0
which is 0. Therefore, x axis is the effect size and y is the power. We
can see that power increases with effect size increasing.

``` r
data_mean = sim_results %>% 
  group_by(beta_1) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean = round(mean(estimate),3)
  )

ggplot(data_mean, aes(x = beta_1, y = mean)) +

  geom_text(aes(y = mean + 0.1, label = mean)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)+
  labs(
    title = "Average estimate of beta_1",
    x = "Beta_1",
    y = "Average estimate"
  ) 
```
